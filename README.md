UAVVaste dataset
The UAVVaste dataset consists to date of 772 images and 3718 annotations. The main motivation for the creation of the dataset was the lack of domain-specific data. Therefore, this image set is recommended for object detection evaluation benchmarking but also for developing solutions related to UAVs, remote sensing, or even environmental cleaning. The dataset is made publicly available and will be expanded.

Download original UAVVaste dataset available also in the Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/record/8214061.
